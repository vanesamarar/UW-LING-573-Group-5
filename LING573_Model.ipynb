            " there is a fee for parking but well worth it seeing no where to park if you do have a car .\r\n",
            " The parking was free, which was great, and the hotel was conveniently located for public transport, and local attractions .\r\n",
            "As for in, and, out parking, I have seen a lot of San Francisco with no car at all .\r\n",
            " They have a parking garage, but they make you leave your vehicle for them to park   and then if you want to take a drive later, you have to wait for the staff to get it .\r\n",
            " There is no real parking space, so I had to pull up in front of the hotel in a small space .\r\n",
            "There was valet parking at a cost of $42 .\r\n",
            " Rooms are very comfortable and we were charged $15 for parking our motorcycle in the garage .\r\n",

            " Of course you have the added thrill of paying over $40 a night for parking and whatever your chiropractor bill is when you are done with the beds .\r\n",
            "I found a great mid week deal that included a discount on parking .\r\n",
            "On the other hand, the valet parking attendant bell people were very friendly .\r\n",
            "Parking is expensive, Rooms are on the small side .\r\n",
            " However, parking is $30 night and valet only, which becomes a pain .\r\n",

            " Parking is expensive   and everything is very much within walking distance .\r\n",
            " Valet parking is, in my view, unreasonably high at $38 per night, but again we knew this before we arrived so can't really complain .\r\n",
            " As most hotels in the city, parking is expensive so unless you really need a vehicle its cheaper to just buy a MUNI Passport during your stay .\r\n",
            " The hotel does have parking, but it is expensive and hard to get around the city while driving .\r\n",
            " The parking was steep  , so if I had to do it again I would have parked 1 2 block north for about half of that .\r\n",
            " Parking at $45 a night was outrageous, but probably worth it to keep your car safe .\r\n",
            " We did not have a car, hotel parking is expensive .\r\n",
            " The valet parking was very convenient and seemed secure as it is attached to the hotel .\r\n",
            " A lot of hotel parking garages lots are not on the same premises as the hotel in the area .\r\n",
            " First, the biggest &quot gotcha&quot  is the mandatory valet parking .\r\n",

            " Onsite parking is available .\r\n",
            " I called before we ever arrived to inquire about it and was told that parking was no problem at all .\r\n",
            " I guess calling to inquire about parking while giving them our name and reservation dates didn't warrant the clerk to inform us that we should make a reservation for our car also .\r\n",

            "The hotel, located a few blocks from Fisherman's Wharf as well as Ghiardelli Square, has a nice Italian theme that carries into the lobby as well as the uniforms for the parking valets .\r\n",
            " Speaking of parking, you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .\r\n",
            " Not only is it pricey at $36 day, but having nothing but valet parking means you have no access to your car unless you have one of the valets fetch it from the lot for you .\r\n",
            " Although our room was indeed non, smoking   and we had a king size bed we ended up on the 3rd floor and our room, facing Mason Street, overlooked a concrete multi, story parking lot although if you stood at the window you could see the Coit Tower which was a nicer view !\r\n",
            " Several have mentioned the charge for parking .\r\n",
            " It really does save if you can get a deal with free parking, but the fee is not out of line .\r\n",
            " Valet parking was $36 a day, but we're not complaining because other SF wharf hotels have charged us a similar fee even without the valet service .\r\n",
            " Another irritant was the crazy parking fees for the hotel .\r\n",
            " They do a good job and are a heck of a lot cheaper than a cab and you wont have to mess with the parking fees .\r\n",
            " When I got a GREAT deal $99 INCLUDING parking !\r\n",
            "The great thing for us was the free parking .\r\n",
            " Normally parking is $36 a night so getting that thrown in was a fantastic steal .\r\n",
            "We stayed at the BW Tuscan Inn only because they were offering a great winter deal , $99 for a room with king, size bed and free parking   .\r\n",
            " Overall, we would recommend this place to friends, especially if they are able to get a good discount and free parking .\r\n",
            " Nice rooms, a bit on the smaller side, but parking right at the hotel .\r\n",
            " staff were helpful although the valet parking and the laundry costs were extremely expensive .\r\n",
            " They allowed this, so we only had to pay the regular parking fee of the hotel .\r\n",
            " Way too much money to pay for parking, but that is the way it is in San Francisco .\r\n",
            " You don't need a car because parking is a nightmare .\r\n",
            "all these hotels charge parking fees .\r\n",
            " Parking at the hotel is expensive at $32 plus tax per night but the up side is that you have in out privilages .\r\n",
            "Parking in the city is a royal pain !\r\n",
            " Although the parking charge is steep, it seems to be the market price in San Francisco, or as the locals like to call it :\r\n",
            " I notice on other reviews the high cost of parking which we didn't have to consider as we were advised you do not need a car to get around SF, and this is quite true .\r\n",
            " All in all, the location was perfect ,  a short walk to the cable cars or bus lines, a Safeway grocery and Walgreens drugs is across the street in a parking garage, type mall, and there are small places to eat breakfast nearby plus an IHOP a few blocks over .\r\n",
            " Parking at the hotel was a hefty $32 per day with unlimited in and out privileges .\r\n",
            " Parking is an issue in SF so either pay the $30 .\r\n",
            " In addition, the valet parking is apparently handled by an outside contractor, and turned out to be considerably more expensive than we had been told ,  $35 day ,  which seemed very high .\r\n",
            " Because of the exhorbitant $29 valet parking fee, we only rented a car for Sonoma and Napa for one day .\r\n",
            " You'll be having fun while some other poor sod is looking for a parking space that isn't there .\r\n",
            "30 am, we discovered that the parking garage next door   would not be open until 7 ,  7 :\r\n",
            " I thought the $29 per day parking was ridiculous, but I hear that's the standard in SF .\r\n",
            "Upon arriving, there was a very long and confusing to do with the valet parking ,  we hadn't gotten our luggage out of th car and the valet wanted the keys .\r\n",
            " There was a fee of $29 per day for the parking .\r\n",
            " Valet parking attendant was no better .\r\n",
            " paid $161 plus tax along with a $20 parking fee .\r\n",
            "As far as parking is concerned, we were shell, shocked at what most of the hotels charge for parkingup to $40 night .\r\n",
            " The Tuscan is $29 night, but if you search for a package rate on their web site, you may get parking included in your room rate .\r\n",
            " And, conveniently, there is a Safeway and a drug store hidden in the parking garage across the street .\r\n",
            " We didnt have or need a car so we didnt have to deal with parking a car I believe it is $30 a day, ,  par for the city .\r\n",
            " It is located 2 blocks from the wharf which was outstanding considering parking is hard to come by .\r\n",
            "Note to those with a car, overnight valet parking is $26 but right next door the car park is $15 and it takes about 30 seconds to get from your car back to the hotel ,  why pay $26 ?\r\n",
            " Parking was $26 day ,  free valet with on and off priv .\r\n",
